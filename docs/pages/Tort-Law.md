# Tort Law

Tort is a civil wrong arising from the Anglo-American common law without any reference to contract.

## Standard of Proof

A simple **Preponderance of The Evidence** will suffice in a Tort trial, as opposed to the standard **Beyond Any Reasonable Doubt** that commonly prevails in a criminal trial.

Tort cases are heard in the Court of Civil Wrongs and may include a jury and a judge, or no jury and simply the judge.

**Note**. Tort law offers the civil remedies of restitution and compensation, NOT the criminal remedy of punishment.

## Remedy

We are not here to extract revenge from the perpetrator of a tort in Civil Court, but rather ...

We wish to extract restitution and compensation for the perpetrator's acts and the plaintiff's damages via the defendant's wallet ( if they still have a wallet ) ...!

A good maxim for Civil Court, is ...

"Don't get mad, just get even."

And, by the word "even", such esoteric and rather subjective remedies as the ethereal **Loss of Consortium** may be invoked in Civil Court in addition to the objective "real" damages of cost.

An example of a "real" cost is a petition to "cover the cost of fixing my guitar that YOU stomped on" ...!

Whereas, an example of a "subjective" remedy is "I was not able to play my guitar during the entire timeframe of disrepair" ...!

Rarely, if ever, an award for **Punitive Damages** is awarded, and rarer still is a lower court ruling that includes punitive damages that survives the appeal process intact.

So, think "even", not "revenge" when addressing a potential Tort case.

That concept of "even" may include an allotment for **Punitive Damages** if the wrong perpetrated by the Tortfeasor is a "social" wrong that has or may risk the lives and betterment of an entire actual or potential set of additional plaintiffs.

## The Settlement

Every successful Tort claim is commonly resolved by a special contract called **The Settlement**.

Most Tort cases, if not all, use this form of contract to discharge the underlying tort obligation.

A sort of pervasive, social-regulatory mechanism ... Do NOT be afraid to settle ANY perceived tort obligation.

## Getting There

**Issue**. Is the legal cost of drilling the well equal to the present worth of the number of barrels expected to be extracted from the process?

**Rule**. The administrative costs of initiating and winning a Tort case ( including the cost of retaining an attorney ) will equal between 50 cents and 70 cents for every ( $1 USD ) one-dollar of gain transferred from defendant to plaintiff.

**Analysis**. If you expect to receive a $66,000 settlement, for example, you may also expect to see over 1/2 ( one-half ) of the judgment deducted as administration costs, including the cost of retaining an attorney throughout the entire affair.

**Conclusion**. Given the now diminished value of the dollars expected, to outlay legal expense today in order to extract those same dollars tomorrow does not square.
